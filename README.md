# Applied-Deep-Learning-HW

This is the homework about the course of the Applied Deep Learning in National Taiwan University.
It will show the 4 topic of the Deep Learning task below.

## HomeWork1
The task about homework 1 is to use the basic RNN model to choose the possible next sentence by given sentence.

## HomeWork2
The task about homework 2 is to use the Language Sequence Classification to classify the news topic.
In this homework, we have to use the BERT language model to let the model know the content of the sentence, 
and use this model to predict the news topic of that sentence.

## HomeWork3
The task about homework 3 is to use the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to play the game.
In this homework, we have to use the game environment in GYM to train our model, 
and let model can play the game by itself. And the games are [LunarLander] and [AssaultNoFrameskip].


## HomeWork4
The task about homework 4 is to use the condition GAN to generate the cartoon faces.
In this homework, we have to use the condition GAN neural network, 
image of cartoon faces and the label of each special feature on the faces to train the GAN model.
Then, use this GAN model to generate the cartoon face which according to the given label.

## Final Project
The task about Final Project is to use the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to play the game which made by myself.
